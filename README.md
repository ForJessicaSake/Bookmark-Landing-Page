# A Bookmark Page developed with TypeScript in React

## About The Project
I jumped right in and started learning TypeScript in December 2022 and then I went ahead to built a frontend mentor project using TypeScript in React. To top it all off, I nailed type checking props, hooks, and reusable components on my first attempt using TypeScript but I'm still struggling to structure my codes, my last deployments failed until I figured some way out of it.
